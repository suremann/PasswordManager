# PasswordManager
very basic password generator and manager
Allows you to generate a password of a specified length containing the selected or specified characters.
Save your password into an encrypted file. CryptoUtils and the other crypto java file were found on the internet with a link
to their source in the comments.
Still in very early stages. Not sure how far I will be taking this, just using code to create something I need.
